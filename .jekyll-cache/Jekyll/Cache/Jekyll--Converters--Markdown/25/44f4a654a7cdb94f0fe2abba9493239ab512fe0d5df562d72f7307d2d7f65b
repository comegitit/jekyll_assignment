I"M<p>Should You Defrag Your Hard Drive? The short answer: Unless you’ve noticed a performance issue with your drive, it’s unlikely you’ll need to make any manual intervention. Disk defragmentation is probably already being done automatically. And in the case of more modern SSD drives, defragging shouldn’t be done at all.</p>
