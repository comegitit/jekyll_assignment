This page tells you a little bit about me.</p>

<p>Hi there! My name is Roy Aggarwal and I live and study in Calgary, Alberta. Like many Calgarians, I am not originally from here. I was born and raised in Germany, and immigrated to Red Deer with my family when I was a teenager. After graduating high school, I attended the University of Alberta where I earned my Bachelor of Commerce degree.</p>

<p>I have had a varied career. Fresh out of school, I started off as a leasing agent for a commercial real estate company before moving other positions in various sales and IT roles. At present, I am an aspiring web developer attending a fast-track certificate program at SAIT. Iâ€™ll be graduating in December and hope to find a practicum in January 2020.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, I enjoy the outdoors while hiking, running, golfing and playing tennis. I have a talented musically inclined 14 year old daughter who sings, plays the bass guitar, keyboard, and drums!</p>
