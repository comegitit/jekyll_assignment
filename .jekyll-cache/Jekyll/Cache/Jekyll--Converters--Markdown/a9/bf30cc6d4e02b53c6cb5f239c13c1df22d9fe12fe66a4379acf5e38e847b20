I"Ë<p>PSA: Disabling Location Services Doesn‚Äôt Eliminate Google Tracking: As a long time android user, I was a bit disappointed to learn of this in this week‚Äôs tech community news. There are arguments to be made on both sides: Tracking enhances and personalizes the user experience vs. (unsolicited) tracking violates the user‚Äôs fundamental right to privacy control.</p>

<p>If you own an android device or rely on Google Maps, opting out is not easy. Google has a vested interest in knowing as much as they can about their users. Depending on how strongly you object to the invasion, I can help by ‚Äúflashing‚Äù a third party OS onto your android device. The other option? iOS. Both pretty drastic. Contact me to discuss your options.</p>
