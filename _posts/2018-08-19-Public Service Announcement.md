PSA: Disabling Location Services Doesn’t Eliminate Google Tracking: As a long time android user, I was a bit disappointed to learn of this in this week’s tech community news. There are arguments to be made on both sides: Tracking enhances and personalizes the user experience vs. (unsolicited) tracking violates the user’s fundamental right to privacy control.

If you own an android device or rely on Google Maps, opting out is not easy. Google has a vested interest in knowing as much as they can about their users. Depending on how strongly you object to the invasion, I can help by “flashing” a third party OS onto your android device. The other option? iOS. Both pretty drastic. Contact me to discuss your options.
