Virtual Private Network (VPN): My Favourite (Free) Solution: There is no shortage of Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers to choose from. Some are paid services, some are free. Very few are free, fast, and offer no server logging. Canadian-owned Windscribe is worth a look If your data needs are relatively modest. Windscribe offers a free tier with a generous 10GB/month quota. There are also paid tiers with larger data quotas and more servers.

Why use a VPN? To enjoy more privacy and security online. To protect yourself from potential financial fraud. Or just to unlock non-Canadian streaming content (for example, Netflix). Windscribeâ€™s VPN service is fast, seamless, and reliable.
