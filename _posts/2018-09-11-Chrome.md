Chrome’s 10 Year Anniversary Release: More Features, Better Looks: If you’re a Chrome user, you may have noticed a few cosmetic changes lately. Beyond the new skin, Chrome 69 also offers new features including better password management, security, and customization. Appearance wise, Chrome has moved to the new softer “Material Design” look with rounded edges and a cleaner look overall. New tabs can be customized with background images and convenient on-page buttons for favourite sites.

This release also offers an updated password handler and form filler. When registering new passwords, Chrome will offer to create strong passwords. These passwords are also synchronized to your Google account so that they are available on other devices that you use Chrome.

If you happen to not like the new Chrome for whatever reason, you can revert to the previous version. Here’s how: First type chrome://flags in the address bar and hit enter. Next, search for “UI Layout for the browser’s top chrome.” Switch from “Default” to “Normal.” Restart Chrome and the familiar interface will return.

Do you prefer the old or the new?
